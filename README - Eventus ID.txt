Eventus ID Version 2.0
Release date: October, 2014


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventus ID is a system for supervised coding of event data extracted from text 
written in Spanish. The program is supervised as it requires human intervention
for developing dictionaries used as search categories and for assessing the 
accuracy of the coding outcome. This software is capable of coding event data 
based on a system of pattern recognition that provides information on who did 
what to whom, when and where. The flexibility provided by two event coding 
algorithms and an event locator protocol fully integrated into the coding 
process enables Eventus ID to identify fine-grained event data at the 
subnational level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first program 
specifically designed for processing short news summaries written in Spanish.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventus ID runs on Windows command line interface.

Eventus ID also requires having Perl 5, or any later version.

Eventus ID requires no specific installation procedure. All it needs is to 
have all the files indicated in the File Manifest contained in the same folder. 

Refer to the User Manual for operation instructions.

  - "EVENTUS_ID_2.0.pl" is the Eventus ID program file.
  - "actors_DEMO.txt" is the file containing the list of actors.
  - "blank_DEMO.txt" is an emptly file for special coding projects.
  - "codigos_Events_DEMO.txt" is the numerical output file.
  - "config_DEMO.txt" is the configuration file for automated coding.
  - "corpus_DEMO.txt" is the text corpus.
  - "estados_DEMO.txt" is the file containing the list of states.
  - "filtros_DEMO.txt" is the file containing the location filters.
  - "municipios_DEMO.txt" is the file containing the list of municipalities.
  - "texto_Events_DEMO.txt" is the textual output file.
  - "verbs_DEMO.txt" is the file containing the list of actions.

"Eventus_ID_2.0_manual.pdf" is the User Manual.

"Recoding_dofiles" is a folder containing an example of Stata dofiles for 
  recoding and aggregating the raw event data output generated by Eventus ID.
  The folder includes the following files:
  - "0_master_dofile.do" is the main dofile for running the other scripts.
  - "1_recoding.do"
  - "2_recoding_special_cases.do" 
  - "3_disaggregate_location.do" 
  - "4_fill_in_locations.do"  
  - "5_aggregate_events.do" 
  - "6_label_variables.do" 
  - "7_graphs.do" 
  - "8_analysis.do" 
  - "codigos_Events_DEMO.txt" is the numerical output generated by Eventus ID.
  - "Data_template.dta" is a database in Stata format structured as time-series
    cross-sectional at the daily-municipal level. The database also contains 
	independent variables for conducting regression analysis.

"SEDENA_permission" is a folder containing the permission given by SEDENA for
  using and sharing the press releases. It also includes the required citation 
  of all the press releases used in the demonstration file.

"Validation" is a folder containing the precision metrics.
  - "human_computer_coding.xlsx" is the file containing the comparision between
    human coding and the machine generated event data. It also calculates the
	precission metrics of recall and accuracy.

"Eventus_ID_extended_application.pdf" is the article long version of the report
  published in the Social Science Computer Review. The document includes a more
  detailed explanation of the coding procedures and an extended application. The
  supplementary files in the "Recoding_dofiles" folder serve to replicate the 
  analysis and results contained in this document.  
	
"GNU general public license.txt" is a file indicating the terms of use.
